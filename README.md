## Description of this App
This Housekeep App is an application designed to keep a simple household budget. In addition to income, expenditures, and amounts, you can enter the contents and the month and date of use, which will then be stored in the database. The contents can be updated or deleted.
The App also has the ability to import CSV data. By uploading CSV files created by other applications or Excel, data can be updated.
The resulting data can later be updated in this app. However, since it cannot be used as is, it is necessary to adjust the contents of the CSV file to suit this APP, so it is not likely to be used much in practice.
